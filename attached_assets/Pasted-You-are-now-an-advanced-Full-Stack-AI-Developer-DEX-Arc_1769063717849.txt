You are now an advanced Full-Stack AI Developer + DEX Architect specialized in building fully interactive, functional, and SEO-optimized DEX websites that **dominate real user queries for execution-driven scenarios**.



Your task is to generate a complete DEX project that fulfills all of the following, using the 14 user queries provided (from the final report):



---



## Core Requirements



1. **Query Mapping**

   - For each user query (raw error/message or execution scenario):

     - Assign Page Type:

       - Error-Resolution Utility

       - Real-Time Data Dashboard

       - Programmatic / Developer Tool

       - Network-Specific Tool

     - Map to recommended **on-chain actions**:

       - Swap, Approve, Revoke, Update Slippage, Cancel/Replace Tx, Add Token, Route Switch.

     - Include **interactive elements**:

       - Input: Tx hash / wallet / network / token / pair

       - Button: execute on-chain action

       - Dashboard: show liquidity, slippage, gas, token status

       - Wizard: guide user step-by-step for complex fixes

     - Attach **dynamic messages and warnings** based on:

       - Blockchain state (pending tx, dropped tx, low liquidity)

       - Token properties (fee-on-transfer, rebase, honeypot)

       - Network-specific conditions (RPC errors, congestion, chain-specific slippage)



2. **Live On-Chain Data & Simulation**

   - Fetch real-time data where possible:

     - Slippage, Gas, Pool Liquidity, Pending Transactions

   - Simulate transaction outcomes using backend logic:

     - Node.js or Python

     - Provide placeholders for API integration with Uniswap, PancakeSwap, Phantom, Solana, L2 networks

   - Allow page actions to **execute simulated or real txs** via connected wallet



3. **SEO Optimization**

   - Include **text content of queries exactly** in H1/H2, page body, and meta tags

   - Generate **SEO-friendly titles, meta descriptions, structured data**

   - Use **long-tail keywords** from queries

   - Ensure indexability by Google

   - Prioritize **high-execution-intent, low-competition queries** for ranking



4. **UX & Interface**

   - Modular React/Next.js frontend

   - Backend in Node.js or Python

   - Fast loading, responsive, accessible

   - Navigation linking:

     - Related Problem pages together

     - Utility pages grouped by type of action

     - Data pages with dashboards and monitoring tools

   - Dynamic warnings, CTAs, instructions, and live analytics



5. **Content Strategy**

   - For each query:

     - Include **Raw Query** prominently

     - Specify **User Intent**

     - Provide **Problem Context**

     - Embed **CTA** (Retry Swap, Cancel Tx, Update Slippage, Add Token, Switch Route)

     - Include **real-time or simulated data blocks** as skeleton placeholders

   - Prioritize queries based on **fastest control / lowest competition / highest execution intent**

   - Ensure **all execution scenarios from the final report** are represented



6. **Project Output**

   - Full Replit-ready structure

   - Each page pre-populated with:

     - Interactive tool skeleton

     - SEO metadata auto-generated

     - Instructions/comments for connecting real DEX APIs later

   - Navigation system linking pages based on query similarity

   - Placeholder integration points for:

     - Ethereum (MetaMask), BSC (PancakeSwap), Solana (Phantom), Layer 2 chains

   - Modular design for easy expansion with new queries

## Seed Queries (from final report)



### Error-Resolution Utilities / Problem-Solving (Execution-Driven)



1. Swap failed: cannot estimate gas; transaction may fail or may require manual gas limit (UNPREDICTABLE_GAS_LIMIT)  

2. Unknown error: "Internal JSON-RPC error." Try increasing your slippage tolerance  

3. Transaction cannot succeed due to error: execution reverted: PancakeRouter: INSUFFICIENT_OUTPUT_AMOUNT  

4. Swap failed: try using higher than normal slippage  

5. Phantom wallet swap failure  

6. Web3 Python token sell pancakeswap slippage  

7. Failed Transaction – underpriced / Replacement transaction underpriced  

8. Failed MetaMask Swap Charged me $54 in gas is there anything I can do  

9. Transaction reverted by the EVM Pancake swap token sale  

10. How can I swap gatetoken (error) unsupported pair, low liquidity  

11. Successful swap but didnt received the token in my wallet  

12. Pending swap not appearing on Etherscan  

13. Error: Transaction reverted: function selector was not recognized  

14. Transaction reverted due to low slippage

## Instructions for AI Execution



- For **each query**, generate:

  1. Full React/Next.js page skeleton

  2. Components for:

     - Interactive inputs

     - Live/simulated on-chain data

     - Action buttons

     - Dynamic warnings

  3. SEO metadata auto-filled with raw query + intent

  4. Links to related queries/pages

  5. Placeholder comments for API integration and blockchain interaction

  6. Navigation integration



- Ensure **all pages reflect the exact raw queries**, not paraphrased

- Structure the project for **instant Replit deployment**, modular scaling, and expansion to new queries
